# 30daysofSQL
This is a 30-day SQL Challenge.

I'll be sharing my learning on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusufokunlola/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yaokunlola).

To join me on this journey, you can follow the roadmap offered by [GeekforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/30-days-of-sql-from-basic-to-advanced-level/).

The dataset to be used for the course is the [AdventureWorks Dataset](https://github.com/yusufokunlola/30daysofSQL/blob/main/AdventureWorks_dataset.zip)

A summary of daily posts can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eMcrvgagJM3xtbZc4a1KDpIkQGHYNNlk4tAM8DUGk7E/edit?usp=sharing).
